Date: 8.29.25 - So far not much has happened in the class other than some basic stuff. 
Just installing git, setting up local and remote repo's, doing stuff with WSL.
The assignment for the journal says that you're gonna be checking in on the journal 
periodically throughout the semester, so I just gotta say. 
It should be an absolute CRIME to use vim in the classroom. Nano FTW...

Date: 9.5.25 - Basically nothing new has happened this week, though it was a short week
so I didn't really expect much to happen anyways. I figured out how to set a virtual
environment, because for some reason using pip outside of a virtual environment throws
a system error. and ChatGPT's answer didn't work. We made a list of ideas for the project, 
and some of it might rely on me finishing the MAGI Project, which I should actually be able
to get started on later today, seeing as I'm buying skylers old server, which
should (hopefully) be able to run a pretty good model once I actually install some GPUs
