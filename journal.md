Date: 8.29.25 - So far not much has happened in the class other than some basic stuff. 
Just installing git, setting up local and remote repo's, doing stuff with WSL.
The assignment for the journal says that you're gonna be checking in on the journal 
periodically throughout the semester, so I just gotta say. 
It should be an absolute CRIME to use vim in the classroom. Nano FTW...
